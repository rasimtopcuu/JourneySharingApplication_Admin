### Bootstrap

Bootstrap contains HTML and CSS based design templates that can be used in web pages or applications. These templates can be used to create interface components such as forms, navigation bars, buttons.

### React Virtual-DOM

Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal or "virtual" representation of a UI is kept in memory and synchronized with the "real" DOM ​​by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called harmonization.

This approach enables the declarative React API: you tell React which state you want the UI to be in and make sure the DOM matches that. This summarizes the feature manipulation, event management and manual DOM update you will have to use to build your application.

Because "Virtual DOM" is a pattern rather than a particular technology, people sometimes say it means different things. In the world of React, the term "virtual DOM" is often associated with React elements because they are objects that represent the user interface. However, React also uses internal objects called "fibers" to hold additional information about the component tree. They can also be considered as part of the "virtual DOM" application in React.
